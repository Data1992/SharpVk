----------

Note that this project is still under active development and testing; all core functions of the core API and WSI extensions are present, and [this issue](https://github.com/FacticiusVir/SharpVk/issues/22) has a complete list of commands that have been tested and shown working. Please be aware that breaking changes may be made to the public API as the bindings move towards v1.
