# SharpVk
C#/.NET Bindings for the Vulkan API & SPIR-V

## Shanq
Linq to SPIR-V shader generation

----------

Note that this project is still under active development and testing; all core functions of the API and WSI extensions are present but not all are fully tested. Breaking changes may be made as the bindings move towards v1.
TODO.md has a complete list of API commands that have been tested and shown working.
